# Capstone Project Requirements

The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use to:

* [Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor](#proposal)
* [Follow an agile development workflow](#agile)
* [Create and deploy a full-stack web app](#create-deploy)
* [Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app](#video)
* [Complete a write-up of the project](#write-up)
* [Add all three of these to an online portfolio](#portfolio)
* [Present your work to the class](#present)

**Rationale**

This capstone project will demonstrate your ability to build fullstack applications from start to finish in a fixed amount of time.  You will demo this application at the capstone showcase, and feature it prominently on your resume.


<a id="proposal"></a>

## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

You will need to come up with a project idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out prioritized feature list

Submit your proposal [here](https://github.com/gSchool/capstone-submissions).

There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy) below.

<a id="create-deploy"></a>

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

* Be sufficiently unique in the cohort
* Have a working front-end and back-end
* Use a single-page app framework for the front-end or native framework (iOS, Android)
* Persist data
* Have some authentication
* Look decent - either using custom CSS or modified Bootstrap
* Use *some significant technology that was not covered in the program*. Examples include:
    * Using Ember, Angular 2, React/Flux etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.6
    * Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
    * Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native Desktop](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
    * Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
    * Using Rails, Spring, Java, or some other backend framework for building APIs
* Have some sort of API integration
  * Email, maps, stocks, text messages, physical devices etc...
  * See http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory for ideas
* Be deployed and ready to demo by the provided deadline
* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

The more creative the better!  Anything from card/board games to highly-specific financial apps or apps you wished you had in previous jobs or other situations are all good candidates.

NOTE: in rare cases apps that don't have all of these components _may_ be approved by instructors.  If you believe your app is sufficiently complex and awesome, please submit your ideas.

## Follow Agile Workflow

* The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to you.

<a id="video"></a>

## Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app

* Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features

<a id="write-up"></a>

## Complete a write-up of the project

* Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
* 1-2 tight paragraphs

<a id="portfolio"></a>

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your respositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

<a id="present"></a>

## Present your work to the class

* Everyone will present at the Capstone Showcase
* Friends/family/employers are welcome to attend.
